## Hey 🖐, I'm Surya!

A seasoned data analyst currently pursuing master's in data analytics and visualization (Yeshiva University, New York).
Since I was young, I have always enjoyed to solve puzzles. I approach data as an interesting puzzle I want to solve. Converting data into meaningful insights is the challenge to me.
I have been working with data for more than two years with experience in retail and supply chain. I have worked for top retail companies which enhanced my ability to derive business insights backed by data.
